# multidimensonal_array_using_python.
<br>
This code prompts the user to enter the number of rows and columns for a two-dimensional array. It then proceeds to create the array by taking input for each element from the user. Finally, it prints the created array along with the dimensions specified by the user.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

User is asked to enter the number of rows (m) and columns (n) for the array.
An empty list 'o' is initialized to store the elements of the array.
Using nested loops, the code iterates over each row and column to take input for each element of the array.
The input element for each position in the array is stored in a temporary list 'l', which is then appended to the main list 'o'.
Once all elements are entered, the code prints a message indicating the dimension of the array.
Finally, it prints the complete two-dimensional array entered by the user.
Overall, this code allows the user to input elements for a two-dimensional array of specified dimensions and displays the array along with its dimensions.
